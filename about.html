    <p>I am on the path. Moving enthusiastically in the direction of my dream of learning to code. The purpose of this website is to chart my journey through concrete steps, one project at a time. It is the place where I am, as Bren√© Brown calls in <em>Daring Greatly</em>, stepping into the arena. This is the place where we show up and get our hands dirty, allowing ourselves to be vulnerable in an effort to grow.</p>

    <p>There are many coding languages to learn and ways to build a website. To start, one must decide what their goals are, figure out what is needed to reach them, then dive in. Here is what worked for me and how this website came about. I bought the domain name for this website from <a href="https://www.hover.com/">hover</a>. It is hosted through <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> on my repository. I was created using HTML and CSS. My projects will start with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then extend to include other languages and technologies over time. To ensure my continued enthusiastic coding and to stay accountable, I joined the <a href="https://www.100daysofcode.com/">#100daysofcode</a> challenge the day I began working on Project 2. <strong><em>Hello World</em>, I am off!</strong></p>
